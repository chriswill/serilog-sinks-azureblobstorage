# Changes

### 1.1.1 2/26/2019
* Updated Readme.md to reflect new configuration change (folderName ==> containerName). The 1.0.4 release should have been incremented to 1.1.0 because it introduced a possible breaking change to configuration settings, so we're catching up now.

### 1.0.1 1/22/2019

### 1.0.0.1 12/10/2018
